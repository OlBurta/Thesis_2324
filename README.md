## Master Thesis in Biomedical Engineering
This repository contains the Python code written in Jupyter Notebooks for my master's thesis titled, "Characterising neurophysiological processes behind Information Processing Speed in Multiple Sclerosis", at Vrije Universiteit Brussel.

### Content
The code is divided into 5 major parts, each forming a separate notebook (except the TDE-HMM Analysis has 2 notebooks, one for the 6 states and another for the 8 states inference):
1. Preprocessing MEG data
2. Behavioral Statistics
3. ERF Analysis
4. Static Coherence Analysis
5. TDE-HMM Analysis

### Additional information
- This repo contains 3 folders: one with the raw .ipynb files, a second with the notebooks in .html format, and a third for the converted pdf format.
- This work used the open-source packages [OSL Python](https://github.com/OHBA-analysis/osl/tree/main) and [OSL dynamics](https://github.com/OHBA-analysis/osl-dynamics) from the OHBA analysis group, Oxford University.
- The MEG/MRI data used in this work was previously collected and belongs to the Artificial Intelligence supported Modelling in clinical Sciences (AIMS) research group at Vrije Universiteit Brussel, and is not publicly available.
